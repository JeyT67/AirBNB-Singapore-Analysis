# AirBnB-Singapore-Analysis

This project uses the linear regression model to predict the outcomes of Singapore regions having high/low correlation against other variables in the dataset using Python for this AirBnB Singapore analysis. By analysing and modeling, it can determine how well the model was able to predict the outcome against the two variables. 

This dataset was also used for tableau visualization to analyse the average prices of the Singapore region in relation to the differents states and room types.
